// Why bind is Necessary in Your Example:
// In the code you provided, the addEventListener callback is called in the context of the button element, 
// not the React class instance. By default, this inside handleClick would refer to the button (<button>), not the React instance.

// To ensure this refers to the React instance (and not the button), you use bind

/*
    When Button is Clicked:
    ---------------------------
    handleClick is invoked with this explicitly set to the React instance via bind.
    
    Outputs:
    -----------
    button clicked
    https://localhost:300
    
    Without bind:
    ------------------------
    . this inside handleClick would refer to the button element, not the React instance.
    . this.server would be undefined.
