Python software for executing python Files likewise we have Node JS software or environment for executing JS Files

Initially, JS software is attached or integrated with the browser, At that time we have to write html syntax and there we have to write the JS code inside the script tag and then that code will be executed in the browser using live server
Later on it was decided to extract it outside the browser so that JS code can be executed standalone like other programming language code, like - C, C++, JAVA, Python

JS softwares or engines that were peresent in the browser, Node JS, Deno JS, V8 Engine

Different Code Editors, like - Visual Studio Code, Jetbrains Fleet, Sublime Text, ...

node -v :: To check which version of Node JS is installed
node "fileName.js" :: To execute the JS Files
